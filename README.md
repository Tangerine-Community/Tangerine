Digitize your EGMA and EGRA data collection with Tangerine. Create your Assessments online, conduct them offline with the Tangerine Android App. All results you collect can be exported as a spreadsheet. Tangerine has been used by over 30 organizations to conduct over 1 million assessments and surveys in over 50 countries and in 100 languages.


## Installation
We recommend using AWS for hosting have documented detailed [instructions for AWS](docs/install-on-aws.md). Below are general instructions for installing on any machine.

SSH into your machine from a terminal, [install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/ubuntulinux/), and then run the following commands. You'll need the version of the most recent release. Find that on the releases page [here](https://github.com/Tangerine-Community/Tangerine-server/releases).
```
# Get the software.
git clone https://github.com/Tangerine-Community/Tangerine.git
cd Tangerine
git checkout <version tag>
# Create config.sh and edit to match your desired settings. Make sure to set `TANGERINE_VERSION` to the same as what `<version tag>` in the prior commands. 
cp config.defaults.sh config.sh
nano config.sh
# Start the software.
./start.sh
```

If your server restarts or the container stops, you can later run the `./start.sh` script in the Tangerine-server folder.

To use SSL, put an SSL enabled Reverse Proxy in front of Tangerine and set the `T_PROTOCOL` variable in `config.sh` to `https` before running `start.sh`. At RTI we use AWS's Elastic Load Balancer in front of Tangerine because it automatically renews and cycles SSL certificates for us. How to set this up is detailed in our [instructions for AWS](docs/install-on-aws.md).  If your Tangerine install is on a Digital Ocean Droplet, you can use their Load Balancers and configure them for SSL. See [How To Configure SSL Termination on DigitalOcean Load Balancers](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-configure-ssl-termination-on-digitalocean-load-balancers).
Now visit your Tangerine-server installation at the IP address or hostname of your installation. In this configuration, the browser talks to the Load Balancer securely on Port 443 while the load balancer communicates with Tangerine Container on port 80 on a private network.


## Upgrade
You can sign up to be notified of releases via email by signing up at the [Tangerine Releases Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/tangerine-releases). When a release is issued, you will find it listed on the Github Releases page https://github.com/Tangerine-Community/Tangerine/releases. Note that a release marked "Pre-release" may not be stable, may corrupt your data, and there will not be an upgrade path for you.  Each release listed on Github Releases come with Release Notes attached which contain upgrade instructions for that release.
