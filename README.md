Digitize your EGMA and EGRA data collection with Tangerine. Create your Assessments online, conduct them offline with the Tangerine Android App. All results you collect can be exported as a spreadsheet. Tangerine has been used by over 30 organizations to conduct over 1 million assessments and surveys in over 50 countries and in 100 languages.


## Installation

See [installation demonstration video](https://vimeo.com/171423878).

The easiest way to get started is to create an Ubuntu 14.04 Droplet on [Digital Ocean](https://digitalocean.com). 

We also have [instructions for AWS](docs/INSTALLATION_AWS.md) which include the following steps.

SSH into it from a terminal, [install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/ubuntulinux/), and then run the following commands. You'll need the URL of the most recent release. Find that on the releases page [here](https://github.com/Tangerine-Community/Tangerine-server/releases).
```
wget <latest release, choose tar.gz option>
tar xvf <the tarball>
cd <the now uncompressed tangerine folder>
cp config.defaults.sh config.sh
# Edit the config.sh file to match your desired settings. Try `nano config.sh`. 
# You must edit all of the variables in the "Required to change" section. 
./start.sh
```

Now visit your Tangerine-server installation at the IP address or hostname of your installation.

If your server restarts or the container stops, you can later run the `./start.sh` script in the Tangerine-server folder. To upgrade your server, run the `./upgrade.sh` script. Note that if you update environment variables in `config.sh`, they will not be propogated to the `settings` doc in each group so certain paths will break. See [issue #114](https://github.com/Tangerine-Community/Tangerine/issues/114) for the status of this.
