## Release Workflow
- Maintainer prepares for a new version by creating a Milestone and adding a place for the release in the `CHANGELOG.md` in the `next` branch.
- Issues are assigned to the Milestone. 
- When you are assigned an issue, create a branch based on the `next` branch named after the issue number and description, something like `1325-fix-some-bug`. Put the PR in the milestone, link to the corresponding issue from the PR and mark issue as "in progress".
- As time progresses while developing your feature, keep your code up-to-date with changes in the next and (after feature freeze) release/v-feature-number branches. The [Gitflow docs](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) explain this process in greater detail. (Main difference - we call the Git Flow 'dev' branch - in our nomenclature - the 'next'branch.)
  
  Git commands to keep your branch in-sync:
  ```shell script
    git pull
    git merge release/v3.x.x # (if currently in feature freeze)
    git merge next
  ```
- When your PR is ready, add notes to the `CHANGELOG.md` file in your branch and request a review.
- After code review, if code is merged, the Maintainer will tag the next branch with a prerelease tag and mark corresponding issue with "review" tag for QA.
