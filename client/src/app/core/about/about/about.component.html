    Tangerine was developed by <a href="https://rti.org" target="_blank">RTI International</a>starting in 2011 with RTI's own internal research funds. RTI redesigned Tangerine and developed a new codebase using latest technologies in 2017/2018 with funding support from Google.org. Tangerine is available to the public through an open-source GNU General Public License. You can host it on your own server and modify its code as needed. The only requirement is that if you share your modified version publicly, you also need to share the modified source code with the larger community. 
  </p>
  <p> 
    Since 2011, Tangerine has been used by over 60 organization, in over 70 countries and 100 languages. While originally developed for education, Tangerine is increasingly used also for interviews and field observations in the health, governance, and agricultural sectors.
