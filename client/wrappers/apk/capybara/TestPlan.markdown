1)  Running sample assessments that include every type of subtest

  a.	Doing things within those subtests like

    i.	Testing that autostop works (done)
      
      a. Consent autostop (if "No" consent, entire assessment should end) (done).
     

    ii.	Testing that skiplogic works (done)
    
      a. ResultOfQuestion  (is / isnt) (done)
      b. ResultOfMultiple  (not "4" in / is / isnt) (done)
      c. ResultOfPrevious  (is / isnt) (done)
  
    iii. Testing that reading comprehension questions are properly linked to how far the student has read (done)
    
    iv.	Testing that you can’t skip subtests without entering data (done)
    
    v.	Pre-assessment subtests
    
      a. Enter data into "School ID", test clear button, re-enter data (done)
      b. Attempt a Pupil ID containing numbers, which should fail. Validate that "Generate" button works, allows user to advance (done)
      
    
    vi. Action on Display items
                -skipping entire subtests (done)
                
                -survey early stop logic (done) 
                
                -dynamic question prompts (done)
                
    vii. Custom validation (done)
    
    
    viii. Testing if abort and resume work with and w/o randomization (w/o randomization working, w/ is having some
    problems that may be associated with Tangerine)) 
    
    ix.  Grid (timed) subtests:
    
      a. Valiidate the asterisk "mark entire line" button functions (still working on this, need to actually look at results window to see if it works)
      b. Validate that the "last item attempted" cannot be placed on a grid item located prior to the last item marked incorrect (done) 
      c. Validate the correct functionality of input mode (e.g. after test has ended, mark item #2 incorrect; move "last attempted" from x to y).
      d. Validate the "Restart" button, re-run test (done)
      e. Attempt to advance past subtest without having indicated last item attempted (done)

    
  b.	Examining the results and making sure they look right
  
    i.	Expand the result on the results page and sanity check
    
    ii.	(perhaps downloading the CSV – this will be harder)
    
2)	Creating assessments using the editor

    i. Using text editor, bold, italic, font size, etc. (working on this atm but having difficulty inserting text into text editor)
    
    ii. Testing if a subtest can be copied to another assessment (done) 
    
    iii. Duplicating an assessment (done) 
    
    iv. Testing if questions can be copied to different assessments (done)
