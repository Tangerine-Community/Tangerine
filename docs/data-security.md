# Data security

## Data privacy and security

Tangerine is designed with data security in mind. Our servers undergo audits in compliance with RTI security policies and adhere to industry security standards. Access is strictly controlled and limited to authorized development team members, solely for the purposes of support, maintenance, and configuration.
All data collected on devices is encrypted to ensure it remains protected, and the communication between mobile application and server also uses a secured channel. User registration is required for both mobile application and the web platform, ensuring that only authorized users can access the collected data. Additionally, Tangerine provides built-in obfuscated data export functionality for enhanced data privacy.
 
## Transparency

Tangerine is transparent throughout the life cycle of data. All data collected on the mobile application is data which was included by design on your forms – no extra information is recorded or transferred elsewhere. All results data remains your property and is never shared with third parties or accessed by RTI. Data and form content can be reviewed on demand to aid the resolution of a support request. 
Data privacy laws and requirements may differ by country. Recognizing this, we offer servers in various locations and regions. Your form design is important and must comply with those rules. For example, include randomized IDs, when you are not allowed to collect personal information; and include a consent input as prove that the participant has agreed to take part in your study. 
 
## Safeguards

Tangerine ensures safe spaces for data collection by assigning web platform project users to access roles. By default, the application supports two user access roles: Admin and Member. Admin users have full access to all features within their assigned groups, while Member users have limited access, typically restricted to viewing data.
The flexible role-based system allows for the creation of custom roles with specific permissions (role with form editing capabilities only). Any data collected using Tangerine’s mobile application is securely stored and can only be accessed by the person who collected the data, or authorized personnel, controlled by authentication and user role assignment, through a data export on the web platform.
Complying with regulations like GDPR, you can request data removal at any time, and removal of backups.
