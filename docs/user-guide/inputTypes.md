Item Editor
===========

The item editor screen is similar for many of the item types. It usually
contains the following elements:



<img src="./media/inputVar.png" width="570">

**Variable name**: This name has to be unique for any instrument/form,
as this will be used for the CSV data output as column header with each
observation/child assessed/interview being a row. Avoid special
characters and spaces, use lowercase only (e.g., "age").

**Label**: This will be the item label/name that will be displayed to
the user (e.g. "How old are you?")

**Question number**: If you input a number in here, you will see that
the entire questions is moved to the right and the question number
stands out when looking at the page. Use this if you are looking for a
visual effect like this.

**Hint Text**: This field allows you to add text that acts as a hint for
the user (e.g., "Enter child's age or year of birth, if known")

**Show if**: This is the place to enter item-level skip logic (see
section 5 of this manual).

**Required:** Selecting this checkbox marks the element as a required
field. This ensures that users will enter a value before proceeding to
other instrument sections or finalizing the instrument/form.

**Disabled**: Selecting this checkbox marks the element as inactive. The
item is visible to the user on the tablet, but its value cannot be
changed.

**Hidden:** Selecting this checkbox makes the element inactive AND
invisible on the tablet.

GPS Item
--------

Use the GPS item to record the location (longitude & latitude) of the
user while filling in the instrument/form.

We suggest placing a GPS item always in its own section. Do not combine
with other items.

When selecting to add an item of the GPS type, Tangerine presents the
below item editor screen.

The following might be a way to configure this item:

**Variable name**: Enter "gps".

**Hint Text**: Leave blank

**Show if**: Leave blank

**Valid if**: Leave blank

**Required:** Select this checkbox to make this a required field.

**Disabled**: Leave blank

**Hidden**: Leave blank

Hit "**SUBMIT**" to see the below item added to the section editor.

LOCATION
--------

This item type offers a dropdown listing of predefined location
information such as, e.g., region, district, and school name. Before you
add this item to your form, you need to upload a location list and
configure Tangerine:

To see a video of how to do this
[![Watch the video](./media/locationVideo.png )](https://youtu.be/RSJmNu7ef3U)


First, decide what levels you would like to show and prepare a CSV file
that contains your locations and ids. Each column header will
present a location level (e.g. column A header might be region; column B
header might be district, etc.). Make sure each level/column header
contains only a single word and no spaces.

Second, define the location levels for Tangerine. Click Configure/Location Lists and add the desired levels using the '+' sign



Click "Create a New Location Level".


<img src="./media/locationLevel.png" height="200">


Enter the name of the "highest" location level under
"Label" (e.g. region). Repeat this process for all other location
levels, however, for each "child" level, select which is the parent
level. E.g. in the case of district, the "Parent Level" would be
"region", and so forth. Hit "Submit" to save.

**NOTE:** You cannot delete location levels. Be careful and deliberate
as you define them for your group. If you made a mistake or need to make
changes, contact the Tangerine helpdesk.

<img src="./media/locationImport.png" height="200">

Next, click the Import tab and select
"Import CSV". Double check that your CSV file contains only
those columns that you have defined as levels and spelled exactly the
same!

Once you selected the CSV, Tangerine will ask you to map the location
levels you already defined to the column headers found in your csv file.

<img src="./media/image48.png" width="570">

Click on the small arrows to select the matching column header. For each
ID field, select "Map a column to a level and select "AutoGeneratedID"
for the ID as shown in the example below.


<img src="./media/image49.png" width="570">


Then click "Process CSV" as shown in the screen above. Once processing
is completed, you will receive a notification like this:

<img src="./media/image50.png" width="570">


Once you have successfully uploaded a location list and prepared
Tangerine, you can add the location input item to your form. The following
might be a way to configure this item, once you completed the above
steps.

If you think that your location list may change significantly, and you'd
like to re-upload it at some point thus not implementing any changes
manually, consider adding manual IDs to your location file. In the
instruction above, you saw how to add the Autogenerated ID that
Tangerine inserts. These IDs, however, are not persisted when you
re-upload your location file. In such cases, where you know that you'd
rather re-upload the entire file, we recommend that you insert an ID
column and you preserve those IDs across versions of your location list.
By doing that you ensure that any matching on location IDs (and not on
Location labels) will be persisted.

To upload a location file with IDs, first create those IDS in the Excel
file. Then, on the Map location field instead of selecting Autogenerated
ID, select the column representing the ID for the corresponding level.

**WARNING:** Upon wiping out the location list when you have not
generated the location IDS, all previous results collected will be
missing the labels for those location and will contain only the old IDs;
all data on the tablets under the Visits tab will show the ID rather
than the label. This is why we **highly recommend** altering the
location list manually or maintaining the IDs across different version
of the location list in your Excel file.

Check out this Excel file to see a location list with IDs that you can
import in Tangerine. The formula for generating the IDs can be copied to
your own file: [Download a sample location list file with IDs](http://bit.ly/2WzcTnB)


<img src="./media/image51.png" width="570">

**Variable name**: Enter "location".

**Hint Text**: Leave blank

**Show levels (ex. county,subcounty):** Enter "province,district,school"

**Show if**: Leave blank

**Valid if**: Leave blank

**Required:** Select this checkbox to make this a required field.

**Disabled**: Leave blank

**Hidden**: Leave blank

**Show meta-data:** Leave blank

Hit "**SUBMIT**" to see the below item added to the section editor.

On the tablet this item will look like this:


<img src="./media/image52.png" width="570">


**NOTE**: Without a location list, no location will be displayed, and
the item will be seen as "loading".

CHECKBOX GROUP (Checkbox, Radio Buttons, or Dropdowns)
------------------------------------------------------

This item type lets you define a checkbox item that lets a user pick one
or more options.

The following might be a way to configure this item:


<img src="./media/checkboxGroup.png" width="570">


**Variable name**: Enter "books".

**Label:** Enter "What kind of books do you like to read?"

**Hint Text**: Enter "Tick all that apply"

**Show if**: Leave blank

**Valid if**: Leave blank

**Required:** Selecting this checkbox to make this a required field.

**Disabled**: Leave blank

**Hidden**: Leave blank

**Value** (answer option): Enter the data value for the first answer
option, e.g., "0"

**Label** (answer option): Enter the label for the first answer option,
e.g., "None"

Hit "ADD ANOTHER" to add additional answer options, e.g.:

**Value** (answer option): "1"


**Label** (answer option): "Storybooks
(fiction)"

Hit "ADD ANOTHER" to add additional answer options, e.g.:

**Value** (answer option): "2"

**Label** (answer option): "Books about real things (non-fiction)

When done adding all answer options, hit "**SUBMIT**".


**NOTE:** The item type "CHECKBOX" only adds a single checkbox to the
form, with the item label being the answer option label.


<img src="./media/image56.png" width="570">


On the tablet this single checkbox item will look like this:



<img src="./media/image57.png" width="570">


RADIO BUTTONS
-------------

Radio buttons are an item type used for items that allow for only one
answer. The configuration for radio buttons is the same as for checkbox
group with one exception. You will see that radio button options have a
checkmark to indicate which answer is **correct**. This is used in
conjunction with the **Threshold** defined in the section header.

<img src="./media/image58.png" width="570">


When you have a threshold defined as 4, and for each question there is
only **one question option** defined as correct, Tangerine will
discontinue (hide the questions) after 4 consecutive replies are given
as not correct. You can use this in EGMA tasks or in any other scenario
where this makes sense

On the tablet the radio button item will look like this:


<img src="./media/image59.png" width="570">


DROPDOWN
--------

Dropdown is an item type used for items that allow for only one answer
to be picked from a dropdown list of items. This item type is convenient
when there are many options to choose from. The configuration for a
dropdown item is the same as for checkbox group.

On the tablet the dropdown item will look like this:


<img src="./media/image60.png" width="570">


TIMED GRID
----------

This item type facilitates timed assessment approaches, e.g., to assess
letter sound knowledge, oral reading fluency or math operations. The
following might be a way to configure this item:

**Variable name**: Enter "letter\_sound".

**Number of columns:** Enter the number of columns by which you'd like
to organize the items. Enter, e.g. "4" (Tip: choose less columns for
larger items, like words or operation problems)

**Hint Text**: Leave blank

**Auto Stop**: The autostop field defines the number of consecutive
incorrect items, starting from the first one, after which the test stops
automatically. For example, with an autostop value of 10, if a child has
the first 10 items all incorrect, the test will stop. If a child has the
first 4 items correct and then the following 10 items incorrect, the
test will not autostop.


<img src="./media/timedGrid.png" width="570">

**Show if**: Leave blank

**Valid if**: Leave blank

**Mark entire rows:** This option allows the user to mark and entire row
of items as incorrect (e.g. if a child skipped an entire row of sounds
in a letter sound assessment)

**Required:** Selecting this checkbox to make this a required field.

**Disabled**: Leave blank

**Hidden**: Leave blank

**Duration in seconds:** Enter the time allowed to complete this
assessment, e.g. "60" for 60 seconds or one minute.

**Options (each option separated by a space)**: Enter all grid items
here. Separate each item by a space from the next; if you have extra
spaces please remove them!

When done adding all answer options, hit "**SUBMIT**".

**NOTE:** For these kids of assessments there are usually instructions
preceding the assessment items. Insert those instructions as a "HTML
CONTENT CONTAINER" item first, as shown below, followed by the "TIMED
GRID" in the same section. We recommend to only feature the instructions
(HTML Content) and Timed Grid in any one section of your instrument/form

On the tablet the timed grid item will look like this:

<img src="./media/image62.png" width="570">

.

HTML CONTENT CONTAINER
----------------------

This item type allows for flexible integration of headers, help text, or
transition messages that do not require any user input or response. You
can treat this container as a variable and hide or show different
instructional text upon the selection of different options.

The following might be a way to configure this item:

**Variable name**: Enter "Assessor instructions".

**Show if**: Leave blank

**Valid if**: Leave blank

**Mark entire rows:** This option allows the user to mark an entire row
of items as incorrect (e.g. if a child skipped an entire row of sounds
in a letter sound assessment)

**Required:** Leave blank

**Disabled**: Leave blank

**Hidden**: Leave blank

**Rows 1-X**: Insert assessor instructions, use html tags to insert line
breaks or formatting (e.g. \<br\> for a line break; \<b\>text\</b\> for
bolding a piece of text, etc.).

When done adding all answer options, hit "**SUBMIT**".

<img src="./media/htmlContainer.png" width="570">


On the tablet this HTML container item will look like this:


<img src="./media/htmlContainerView.png" width="570">


Copying Items
-------------

If you have an element and/or content which is the same as a previous
element (e.g., radio buttons) that you would like to insert into your
instrument quickly, without having to click "INSERT HERE" again, there
is a COPY feature that you can use to do this. First, enter your
original content (e.g., variable name, labels, and values) and then
click **SUBMIT**. Once the first step is complete, next you click on the 
<img src="./media/image39.png" height="30">
icon. Doing
so automatically creates a duplicate of all your original content,
except the variable name, which you will need to edit, if desired. In
the image below, you can see that all duplicates are auto-populated with
the name "widget," followed by an underscore, and a mix of letters and
numbers (always different from the previous copy). If you would like to,
you can edit all the content of the copy to fit your needs.
