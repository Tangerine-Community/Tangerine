# Installing Tangerine on AWS

## Creating the AWS instance
Login to AWS and Launch a new instance with Ubuntu 16.04 using a t2.medium server with 4 GiB memory. 

Volume should be larger than the 8GB default. 24GB would be useful.

### Security
Make sure to assign a security group to your instance that allows you to access port 80 via a web browser and port 22 via ssh. 

- HTTP: TCP	80	0.0.0.0/0
- SSH	TCP	22	0.0.0.0/0


## Set up SSL
Prerequisites:
- An SSL Certificate. If you don't yet have one, we recommend using AWS's Certificate Manager (found under "Security, Identity, and Compliance").

Create and Configure an Elastic Load Balancer (ELB):
- Go to EC2, click "Load Balancers" in the left column, click "Create Load Balancer", and then select "Classic Load Balancer". 
- Step 1: Define Load Balancer 
  - Set a Load Balancer name to what you want.
  - Set "Load Balancer Protocol" on the left most column to "HTTPS".
  - Set "Instance Protocol" in the third column to "HTTP". 
  - Click "Add".
  - In the new row set "Load Balancer Protocol" to "HTTP" and "Instance Protocol" to "HTTP". 
  - Click "Next".
- Step 2: Assign Security Groups
  - Select "Create a new security group".
  - Set rules for __both__ HTTP and HTTPS. If you only do HTTPS, anyone who goes to `http://yourdomain.com` will get an Access Denied message. Allow them to access the site with HTTP, the software will forward them to HTTPS automatically.  
  - Click "Next".
- Step 3: Configure Security Settings
  - If you have an SSL certificate, you can upload that here. Otherwise select "Choose an existing certificate from AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)".
  - If you have not requested a certificate for your domain yet, you will need to click "Request a new certificate from ACM" and follow those instructions before proceeding.
- Step 4: Configure Health Check
  - Ping Protocol: HTTP
  - Ping Port: 80
  - Ping Path: /app/tangerine/index.html
  - Response Timeout: 5 seconds
  - Interval: 10 seconds
  - Unhealthy threshold: 10
  - Healthy threshold: 2
- Step 5: Add EC2 Instances
  - Select the EC2 instance running Tangerine.
- Step 6: Add Tags 
  - No tags are required for Tangerine.
- Step 7: Review
  - If everything looks good, go ahead and create it!
- Now proceed to your Load Balancers dashboard, click on your load balancer, click on the Instances tab, and now wait for your EC2 instance to be listed as "InService". 
- Configure your domain's DNS to point to this load balancer by clicking on the load balancer's Description tab and using the "DNS name" given to configure your Domain's DNS. 

## Login
Once your server is created, login with your key:
```` 
 ssh -i ~/.ssh/iyour_key -l ubuntuÂ <your EC2 instance's IP address>
````
## Install Docker
Follow the instructions here: https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/ubuntulinux/

## Install Tangerine
Follow the instructions here: https://github.com/tangerine-community/tangerine#installation

## View Tangerine in browser

You should now be able to view Tangerine in your web browser by pasting the ip address of your instance and log in with the credentials for user1 that you added to your `config.sh`.
