# Installation and Testing on AWS

The instructions in the Tangerine Readme recommend installing Tangerine on a Digital Ocean instance. This document provides instructions 
for installing on Amazon AWS and additionally provides instructions for testing Tangerine. 

These instruction require some knowledge of AWS and Linux.

## Creating the AWS instance

Login to AWS and Launch a new instance with Ubuntu 14.04 using a t2.medium server with 4 GiB memory. 

Volume should be larger than the 8GB default. 24GB would be useful.

### Server details
Ubuntu Server 14.04 LTS (HVM), SSD Volume Type - ami-fce3c696 <br/>
Ubuntu Server 14.04 LTS (HVM), EBS General Purpose (SSD) Volume Type.<br/>
Root Device Type: ebs Virtualization type: hvm

### AWS Instance details

<th>Instance Type</th><th>ECUs</th><th>vCPUs</th><th>Memory (GiB)</th><th>Instance Storage (GB)</th>

<tr>
<td>t2.medium</td><td>Variable</td><td>2</td><td>4</td><td>EBS only</td>
</tr>
</table>


Storage : default (8 GiB)

### Security
Security group: 

- HTTP: TCP	80	0.0.0.0/0
- SSH	TCP	22	0.0.0.0/0

## Login
Once your server is created, login with your key:
```` 
 ssh -i ~/.ssh/iyour_key -l ubuntuÂ ec2-54-999-99-99.compute-1.amazonaws.com
````
## Installing Docker
Follow the instructions here: https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/ubuntulinux/
 
Commands I used in following those instructions:


    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https ca-certificates
    sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://p80.pool.sks-keyservers.net:80 --recv-keys 58118E89F3A912897C070ADBF76221572C52609D
    sudo vi /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list
    (creates a new file)
    enter the following:
    deb https://apt.dockerproject.org/repo ubuntu-trusty main
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get purge lxc-docker
    apt-cache policy docker-engine


That last command verifies you are pulling from the correct repo

Install dependencies for docker


    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install linux-image-extra-$(uname -r)
    sudo apt-get install apparmor


Now install docker


    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install docker-engine
    sudo service docker start
    
    (docker will already be running)


Verify that all is installed correctly:

    sudo docker run hello-world

Now you are ready to install Tangerine.

Go to the [Tangerine Releases page](https://github.com/Tangerine-Community/Tangerine/releases) and copy the .tar.gz file 
of the latest release

    wget https://github.com/Tangerine-Community/Tangerine/archive/0.3.0.tar.gz
    tar xvf 0.3.0.tar.gz
    cd Tangerine-0.3.0
    cp config.defaults.sh config.sh
    nano config.sh
    Change T_HOST_NAME to your instance's IP address
    Change T_USER1_PASSWORD and T_PASS to password of your choice.
    Control O and control X to save and exit.

Login as sudo:

    sudo -i
    cd /home/ubuntu/Tangerine-0.3.0
    enter:
    ./install.sh

This will download and extract the docker image from Tangerine on docker hub.

## View Tangerine in browser

You should now be able to view Tangerine in your web browser by pasting the ip address of your instance.
