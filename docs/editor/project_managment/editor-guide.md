# Releasing updates to existing forms

## Gotchas
- If you remove an input from an item or move that input to another item, when a user resumes a form response that was created with the prior version, content for that input will appear to have dissappeared.
- If you add remove an item from a form, when users resume form responses created on with the prior version, it will appear they have lost data since the item has been removed.
