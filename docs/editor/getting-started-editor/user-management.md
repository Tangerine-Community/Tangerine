# User management

Tangerine offers comprehensive, role-based access management features. By default, the user1 account can do everything but this access can be delegated to other users. The User menu can be accessed by going to the main group listing page and the selecting the Users menu on the left side. 

## Add user

To add a user press the "+" button at the bottom and enter this user's details.

## Delegate user1/admin roles to other users

The main Admin user, namely user1, has access to the full Tangerine backend functionality by default. Some of this user’s responsibilities can be shared with other users through the user management interface. To assign responsibilities to other users click the Shield icon next to the username. 
 
It will bring up the site-wide permissions screen:

We recommends taking great care in assigning such sitewide permissions to other users, including to ensure data privacy and security. Roles that can be assigned sitewide, include: 

Can create groups – users with this role can create new groups on the site 

Can view users list – user can access the listing of all users on the site 

Can create users – allows new users to be created 

Can edit users – users with this permission can update other users’ details and passwords 

Can manage site wide permissions – users with this role can grant those site wide permissions on other users.  


## User roles

The role-based access in Tangerine can be refined and adjusted on a per group basis. By default, Tangerine comes with two user roles:

 - Admin, who can access everything in that group
 - Member, who has access to the data but cannot modify the forms. 

The Admin role can be assigned to more advanced users, and those who need to update forms or other content. The Member role is, e.g., often given to data analysts. This user can generate a data export file and can access the metadata for each form in the group but cannot edit forms or change other users’ permissions. 
 
## Assign a user to a group

Assigning a user to a group is done for each group independently in Tangerine. This function is under the Configure tap, by selecting Users and Roles, and using the “+” button at the bottom right to assign a user to the group. Type the username and select the role before clicking Add user to Group.

All additional users are created using the User Management screen. If only creating a user under the User Management section, this user has no access to the site’s content (groups). The user must first be assigned to a group. This is to ensure that the correct access is given to each user. Custom user roles are created when necessary and assigned to some users. The default two roles have their group permissions pre-configured upon group creation.  

## Add a new role

    Roles in Tangerine exist on per group bases. You have to add roles to each group if using custom roles
