# Creating a New Instrument/Form
## Prerequisite: Existing group or create a new Group

After creating a group or opening an existing one, you will be presented with various options. The first action that you may wish to take is to create a new Form

From the main menu options, select Author and then click Forms. This will bring up a listing of all forms for this group.

You will notice that there is also a User Profile form. This form represents the profile each user has to fill in on the tablet, after they create their user login details. All information that you require in the user profile is attached to each record in the CSV export file. The user profile represents your assessor's information.

Click the plus icon ![plusIcon](media/plusButton_small.png) to create a new form. A new form with a default name is created and a default section is placed into this form. To change the form's name, type in the new text and click Save.

## Form Actions

Beside each of the forms you will see some action available. From here you can Edit, Print, Copy, Delete, or Archive a form. We recommend that you archive your forms instead of removing them. This will ensure that you can export the data of a form that is no longer in use.

Click on the pen icon to modify the form. Each form contains a number of sections that represent your form's pages

Click on the print icon to open a new printable menu where you can select two of the print details. This printable view we often use to quality assure (QA) the instrument or to get a list of variables and their definition. You can also use the print screen to save paper copy of your form.
