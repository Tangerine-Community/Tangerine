# Creating a New Instrument/Form
## Prerequisite: Existing group or create a new Group

After creating a group or opening an existing one, you will be presented with various options. The first action that you may wish to take is to create a new Form

From the main menu options, select Author and then click Forms. This will bring up a listing of all forms for this group.

You will notice that there is also a User Profile form. This form represents the profile each user must fill in on the tablet, after they create their user login details. All information that you require in the user profile is attached to each record in the CSV export file. The user profile represents your assessor's information.

Click the plus icon <img src="../media/plusButton_small.png" width="30"> to create a new form. A new form with a default name is created and a default section is placed into this form. To change the form's name, type in the new text and click Save.

On this page we see the form's name and beside it there are 4 buttons:

Edit HTML - this action button allows us to edit the code for the form. Use this only if you are an advanced user with knowledge of HTML

Preview - this button allows us to preview our work. Note that when we use the preview function, no data is saved to the database.

Save - this action button allows us to save the order of sections or their deletion. This button has another hidden function. When you press it, Tangerine also checks if there are duplicated variables on the form and will alert you if such are found.

Advanced - same as clicking the "advanced settings" link below the form title - here we have access to configure:
the Cycle Sequences and the form's on-open, on-change, and on-submit events. We mostly use the on-change event to insert skip logic to hide or show entire sections. All other events can be used to insert custom coding into your form.

## Form Actions

Beside each of the forms you will see some action available. From here you can Edit, Print, Copy, Delete, or Archive a form. We recommend that you archive your forms instead of removing them. This will ensure that you can export the data of a form that is no longer in use.

Click on the pen icon to modify the form. Each form contains several sections that represent your form's pages

Click on the print icon to open a new printable menu where you can select two of the print details. This printable view we often use to quality assure (QA) the instrument or to get a list of variables and their definition. You can also use the print screen to save paper copy of your form.

Click on the trash icon to delete this form.

If a form is archived, click the un-archive button to activate a form. Only active forms are displayed in tablet listing of forms to the assessor.
