# Creating a New Group
Upon logging into your Tangerine instance, you will see a screen listing your Tangerine groups. You might think of groups as discrete data collection efforts that might contain several instruments or forms. If you have, e.g., a baseline data collection and an endline data collection for the same project, you might make these two different groups. When packaging your instruments into the apk (.apk is the application installation file format for Android devices) for installation on an Android device, Tangerine packages all instruments in a group. Thus, you should set up groups and categorize instruments accordingly.
