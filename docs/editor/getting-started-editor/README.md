# Overview

Tangerine contains an extremely extensible foundational framework that allows the form developer to highly customize the core functioanlity, actions, and progression. The following section provides guidance and common examples for extending Tangerine.

## Tangerine Editor

In Tangerine, you start by building your forms (evaluations, tools, or surveys) using the platform’s Editor interface. It is user-friendly and lets you set up the structure of your form and add all your questions using a variety of question types. Once you’re happy with the setup, you can preview your form to see how it looks and make any tweaks if needed.
Next, you deploy your app and install it on a mobile device or use it in the Chrome browser. Now, data collection begins. Tablet users can start filling out forms by selecting any of the ones created for their group. Data collectors sync their devices and make the data available on the platform’s backend. A data manager can export it as CSV file ready for reporting integration or direct analysis in Excel.
