## Content Sets 
Content Sets are groups of forms and configuration you can use as a template for new groups.

## Anatomy of a Content Set

### Version 1 (< Tangerine v3.13.0)
In the root directory of a v1 Content Set, you will find the following:
- `./app-config.json_example` (required)
- `./forms.json` (required)

### Version 2 (> Tangerine v3.13.0)
Starting in Tangerine v3.13.0, the second iteration of Content Sets was launched. In the root directory of a v2 Content Set, you will find the following:

- `./client/` (required): The folder containing content that will be deployed to Tablets.
- `./client/app-config.defaults.json` (required): Defaults to use for `app-config.json`. For example, a Case Module enabled group would have a `"homeUrl"` property with a value of `"case-home"`.
- `./client/forms.json` (required)
- `./editor/` (required): A folder containing assets pertanent to how Editor behaves.
- `./editor/index.html` (required): The file loaded when displaying the Dashboard in a group's Editor.
- `./README.md` (suggested)
- `./docs/` (suggested)

### Version 2.1 (>= Tangerine 3.15.0)
Starting in Tangerine v3.13.0, content sets gained a package.json and build step. The package.json specifies the required libs and scripts for the content set. If the content set uses custom scripts, these scripts are compiled by the included webpack. Note that .gitignore ignores the compiled code - client/custom-scripts.js - to avoid conflicts.

To install the 2.1 content set - instead of npm install, run `npm run install-server`.

Be sure to update any cron jobs to include the new build commands if they are using content set 2.1:

``
git pull
npm run install-server
npm build
``

If using Content set 2, this build process is not necessary. However, it is an advantage for cs2 users to upgrade to be able to pin the webpack version in packagejson and also to not have the huge custom-scripts file.

## Creating a new Content Set

## Importing a Content Set into Tangerine

New group set:
- git clone tangerine starter repo
- Modify content as needed
- Push to Git
- On server instance, setup GH deploy key by navigating to your Repository on Github and click on `Settings -> Deploy keys -> Add deploy key` and paste your Docker instances /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub in the key contents, enable "Allow write access" and save.
Run `docker exec tangerine create-group "New Group A" https://github.com/id/tangerine-content.git` using the cli
- Add crontab entry that uses the non-pub key to do the pull, npm run install-server, npm run build.
