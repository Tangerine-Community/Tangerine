# Restoring from an Encrypted Backup

## Backing up

Ask user to go to Export Data and press "Export Data for all Users". It wiil display an alert after each database backup is saved. The backup files will be saved in the `Android/data/org.rti.tangerine/files` directory. Use Android File transfer to transfer the files. Save *all* of the database backup files.

## Restoring a backed-up encrypted database onto a fresh Tangerine app installation.

This only works for sync-protocol-2. 

Connect the tablet to the pc with a USB cable. Use Android File transfer to browse to the `Download` directory. Create a new directory called `restore` inside the `Download` directory so that the following directory structure exists: `Download/restore`. Copy all database files generated by the Export Data command from the pc to the `restore` directory. 

Install the Tangerine app on the tablet.  From the language dropdown screen, click a link marked `Restore database`.

Follow the instructions. After the restore process is complete, click the context button (|||) to close Tangerine and launch it again to load with the restored databases.

## Viewing data from an encrypted backup

This is a deep dive - you probably don't need to do this. 

Ask user to go to Export Data and press "Export Data for all Users". The backup files will be saved in the `Android/data/org.rti.tangerine/files` directory. Transfer the shared-user-database file. Then ask the user to go to the About menu and read off the Device ID. 

In Fauxton, look up the device record in the group-uuid-devices database. Copy the value for the `key` property.

Building SqlCipher on MacOSX:

```shell script
git clone https://github.com/sqlcipher/sqlcipher.git
cd sqlcipher/sqlcipher
./configure --enable-tempstore=yes CFLAGS="-DSQLITE_HAS_CODEC -I/usr/local/opt/openssl/include/" LDFLAGS="/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib/libcrypto.a"
```

To use the compiled sqlcipher:

```shell script
sqlcipher/sqlcipher ~/Downloads/shared-user-database
```
In the sqlcipher console, enter the key:

```sql
PRAGMA key = '673939d9-1fae-457e-8eea-7e8cd1de08a5';
```

To list tables:

```sql
.tables
```
Output: 
```shell script
attach-seq-store  by-sequence       local-store
attach-store      document-store    metadata-store
```
