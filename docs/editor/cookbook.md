# The Tangerine Form Editor's Cookbook
Examples of various recipes for Tangerine Forms collected throughout the years. To create your own example, remix the [example](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/remix/tangy-form-example-template) on glitch.com.

## Skip a question based on input in another question
In the following example we ask an additional question about tangerines if the user indicates that they do like tangerines.

## Indicate a mutually exclusive option in a checkboxes group such as "None of the above"
In the following example when you make a selection of a fruit and then choose one of the mutually exclusive options, your prior selections will be deselected.

[Run example](https://mutually-exclusive-checkbox-options.glitch.me/) - [Open Editor](https://mutually-exclusive-checkbox-options.glitch.me/#edit) - [View Code](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/mutually-exclusive-checkbox-options?path=index.html)

## Capture and show local date and time
Sometimes we want to show the user the local date and time to ensure their time settings are correct. 

[Run example](https://capture-local-date-and-time.glitch.me/) - [Open Editor](https://capture-local-date-and-time.glitch.me/#edit) - [View Code](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/capture-local-date-and-time)

## Show a timer in an item
Let's say you want to show a timer of how long someone has been on a single item. This calculates the time since item open and displays number of seconds since then in a tangy-box.

[Run example](https://show-a-timer-in-an-item.glitch.me/) - [Open Editor](https://show-a-timer-in-an-item.glitch.me/#edit) - [View Code](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/show-a-timer-in-an-item)

![stop watch](./tangerine-form-editors-cookbook--stop-watch.gif)

## Capture the time between two items
Sometimes we want to know how much time passed between two points in a form. This example captures, the `start_time` variable on the first item, then `end_time` on the last item. Lastly it calculates the length of time.

[Run example](https://capture-the-time-between-two-items.glitch.me/) - [Open Editor](https://capture-the-time-between-two-items.glitch.me/#edit) - [View Code](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/capture-the-time-between-two-items?path=index.html)

## Hard checks vs. soft checks
A "hard check" using "valid if" will not allow you to proceed. However a "soft check" using "warn if" will allow you to proceed after confirming.

[Run example](https://soft-checks-vs-hard-checks.glitch.me/) - [Open Editor](https://soft-checks-vs-hard-checks.glitch.me/#edit) - [View Code](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/soft-checks-vs-hard-checks)

## Set selected value in radio buttons
In the following example we set the value of a `<tangy-radio-buttons>`.

[Run example](https://set-value-of-tangy-radio-buttons.glitch.me/) - [Open Editor](https://set-value-of-tangy-radio-buttons.glitch.me/#edit) - [View Code](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/set-value-of-tangy-radio-buttons)

![set-value-of-tangy-radio-buttons](./set-value-of-tangy-radio-buttons.png)


## Dynamically prevent proceeding to next section
In the following example hide the next button given the value of some user input.

[Run example](https://dynamically-prevent-next.glitch.me/) - [Open Editor](https://dynamically-prevent-next.glitch.me/#edit) - [View Code](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/dynamically-prevent-next)
