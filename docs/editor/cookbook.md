## Show a timer in an item
Let's say you want to show a timer of how long someone has been on a single item. This calculates the time since item open and displays number of seconds since then in a tangy-box.

[Run example and see code](https://codepen.io/rjsteinert/pen/abzYqvb)

## Capture the time between two items
Sometimes we want to know how much time passed between two points in a form. This example captures, the `start_time` variable on the first item, then `end_time` on the last item. Lastly it calculates the length of time.

[Run example](https://capture-the-time-between-two-items.glitch.me/) - [Open Editor](https://capture-the-time-between-two-items.glitch.me/#edit) - [View Code](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/capture-the-time-between-two-items?path=index.html)
