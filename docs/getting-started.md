# Getting Started

The starting point for Tangerine is dependent on what your role with the product will be. Are you a Project Manager looking to deploy Tangerine to help you manage data collection in your next project? Are you a Systems Administrator working on the back-end to make sure that Tangerine is operational on your company's technology? Or are you a forms developer, taking the questions for the survey and creating the digital forms in Tangerine, or are you a in the field data collector actually running the surveys? Depending on which of these roles fits will define where you should start. If you fall into multiple roles, try to follow this documentation path System Administrator -> Project Manager -> Forms Editor -> Data Collector. Use the tables below to determine your starting point.

Since Tangerine is an open-source platform, you are welcome to develop off of our code if you wish. Go to the [Tangerine Community](https://github.com/Tangerine-Community/Tangerine/) to see the code or navigate to our [Developer Guide](developer/class-docs.md).
