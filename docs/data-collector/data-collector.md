# Data collection on Device

To start collecting data you should open/play the form for the data collection. In the example below I will start the "Simplified EGRA: Reading Assessment" On the first section we always see only the Next button to proceed. Note that depending on how a section is configured you may or may not see the Back button.

Tap the Play button on the left of the form name. This will begin the form, and you can answer each question one by one. All forms are organized sections, and each section contains some questions. 

Use the Back and Next buttons (if enabled)to go back and forth from one section to another:

Each page/section contains different question. Some question may be required and others optional. You have to complete all required questions. In a case where you didn't respond a required question, Tangerine will not let you proceed. Below I didn't respond to the gender question and upon clicking Next, Tangerine marked this question with a red exclamation point and forces me to fill it in.

Other questions are only visible when certain conditions are met. You can see how below upon tapping Yes for questions 3c, another question appears 3d.

The last page of the form always has a Submit button. It is important to press this Submit button when you reach the last page. By tapping Submit you will mark your form as complete.

After tapping Submit you will get a screen similar to the one below. This summary screen allows you to review the form you just entered. The review is in read only form. No data can be modified after submission. Tap the Open All Items to open each completed section in read only mode or scroll down and tap the Open button on any of the sections to review the responses. 

!!! note 
    Tap the Tangerine icon to go back to the form listing page

If you are currently entering data on one of the forms and you click any other link in the application (Below I tapped the Tangerine icon on the top left),  you will receive a confirmation message from Tangerine warning you that you are exiting a data entry form. If you tap OK here you will exit the current form. If you pressed a button by mistake tap Cancel to remain on the form.

# Timed/untimed grid inputs

We use grid input mostly to perform reading tasks, or even, math operation under some specified time

!!! warning 
    Different to all other inputs, where the user/assessor selects the applicable / correct response which will then be marked in blue, in grids, the user has to select all **INCORRECT** items (they will turn blue).

# Resuming Instrument

Should an administration be interrupted, or to be completed at a later stage, navigate to "**Visits**" on the top of the tablet screen.
We use the Visits tab to show previously entered data for a school or go back to a form response to complete it. If the tablet restarts on its own, or you accidentally lose your place in a form, you can always go back to it. 

!!! warning 
    The visits tab groups all forms by location. Without a location list loaded and a location input on your form, your forms will be available under the noLocation group.

From the main home screen tab the Visits tab to go to previously entered form responses.

The screen is organized by school, or by the bottom most level in the location input. In some cases this can be student, or teacher. If you the form you want to resume doesn't contain a location selection, this form will be listed under the noLocation. Tap the desired location (or noLocation) to get a listing of all forms available for this location.

On the screen below we see the form name, the complete column indicating if the form was submitted, and the date and time that the form was started.

You can return from the "Visits" page to the main screen by hitting the Tangerine icon on the top left corner
