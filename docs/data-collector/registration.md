# User registration

When you start the app for the very first time, you are required to create a login and fill in a user profile (assessor profile). Upon starting the app for the first time if you see any permissions requests, please allow them. You will now have Login and Registration screen

To create a new user click the Register tab.

Now enter your user information and click Submit. The username you enter here will be attached to each form that you collect with this user. Use a descriptive username, for example First Initial + Last name or similar. 

The birth year below is only used in the case when you want to reset your password. Put in the correct birth year here. If you forget your password, you'll be asked to provide the same year to reset it.

The next page asks you to fill in the user profile (assessor/enumerator profile) and click Submit. All of this information is attached to each form completed on this app. 
Note that the use profile is customizable, and you may be asked to fill in different type of information. A typical user profile asks you to fill in your name and phone number.

After clicking submit you will be redirected to the form listing. Below there is a sample list of forms available for me to fill in.

# Password Reset

Open the app (or logout) and then click the Reset Password button, this will bring you to a screen which allows you to reset your password. What you need is the exact birth year, as entered during registration. 

 - Select your username from the dropdown
 - Enter the exact birth year used during registration
 - Enter the new password
 - Repeat the new password
 - Click the Submit button when the information has been entered

If all went well, your password is updated, and you are once again on the Form Listing screen. 

If you get a Password Reset Unsuccessful message. It means that the birth year entered on the form doesn't match the one used during registration. Update the birth year and try again.

!!! note 
    If you are not able to reset your password and you cannot gain access to the application, you still have one option left. Create a new user with a different username
