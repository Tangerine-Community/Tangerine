# Data Synchronization

Whenever possible during data collection, recommend that users /assessors to sync their data to the tablet by navigating to the profile
menu, and select "**Sync**".

After completing a form, this form is locked and stored on your device. To upload a form, you have to go to the Sync page. Access the Sync menu by locating the top right burger menu and selecting Sync. This will bring you to the Sync/Data upload page. 

Below you see a summary of sync process. We have 7 responses not synced and 0 synced. Underneath this summary you see the Sync data for all users button. Pressing this button will upload the data for all users registered on this device. 

Further down you can see a break down by user. In my example there is only one user on the tablet and therefore we only see the Username: lachko

Once the sync is complete, Tangerine will show "**100%**" for the field
"**Percentage uploaded**".
