## Debugging Tangerine Forms 
A response to a form is captured in a Tangerine Form Session. When entering a response into a form, you can watch live changes to the Tangerine Form Session by installing the [Redux DevTools Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd) for Chrome. The [PouchDB Inspector extension for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pouchdb-inspector/hbhhpaojmpfimakffndmpmpndcmonkfa?hl=en) can be used for inspecting the data saved to the database.

Start by opening the Chrome Dev Tools by clicking on Chrome's hamburger menu, go to "More tools", and click on "Developer Tools". Redux DevTools and PouchDB Inspector are then available as tabs.
