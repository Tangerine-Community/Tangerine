                <h3>About Tangerine</h3>
                <p>
                    Tangerine is open source software designed for Android mobile devices. Its primary use is to enable
                    capture of students’ responses in oral reading and mathematics skills assessments as well as
                    interview
                    responses and field observations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Using Tangerine improves data quality and the efficiency of data collection and analysis. The
                    software
                    simplifies the preparation and implementation of field work, reduces student assessment times,
                    reduces
                    measurement and data entry errors, and eliminates manual data entry from paper forms. Tangerine is
                    optimized for offline data collection in low-bandwidth environments and features powerful sync and
                    data
                    backup options.

                    Tangerine was developed by <a href="https://rti.org" target="_blank">RTI International</a> starting
                    in
                    2011 with RTI's own internal research funds. RTI redesigned Tangerine and developed a new codebase
                    using
                    latest technologies in 2017/2018 with funding support from Google.org. Tangerine is available to the
                    public through an open-source GNU General Public License. You can host it on your own server and
                    modify
                    its code as needed. The only requirement is that if you share your modified version publicly, you
                    also
                    need to share the modified source code with the larger community.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since 2011, Tangerine has been used by over 60 organization, in over 70 countries and 100 languages.
                    While originally developed for education, Tangerine is increasingly used also for interviews and
                    field
                    observations in the health, governance, and agricultural sectors.
